# Cat Run

Author: Anne He and George Ralph

Design: You are a (time lord?) cat in an endless procedurally generated runner. Spin the tiles to prevent yourself from falling.

How To Play:

Use arrows or A/D to rotate the tiles. Press space to jump. Hold Up/W or Down/S to speed up and slow
down. Changing time is powerful but also tricky. The speed of the game increases as you progress.
